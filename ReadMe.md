MyAssumptions:
    1) You just mension html, css, js, bs, and jquery, no mension of AJAX so i didn't use it.
    2) In pagination there is next button and previous button as well as new and older I assume that newer suppose to display the last group of the repos and the older suppose to display the first group while the >> display the next page
    3) The image of the assinment have an icons so i assume i can user google icons
